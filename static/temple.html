    <p align="justify">The tallest Nandi statue in India is currently under construction in Vellalakundam village, near Salem, Tamil Nadu. Standing at a projected height of 45 feet, it is set to surpass all existing Nandi statues in the country.â€‹Initiated in 2021 by local resident Rajavel, the project aims to create a monumental Nandi statue alongside the Rajalingeshwarar Shiva temple. The design and sculpting are led by renowned sculptor Thiyagarajan, who previously crafted the famous Batu Caves Murugan statue in Malaysia.The statue is being constructed using iron rods and concrete, with a final coat of white paint to enhance its visual appeal. The project has garnered support from local devotees and is expected to become a significant pilgrimage and tourist destination upon completion.</p>
